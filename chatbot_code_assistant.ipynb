       "> Model: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear syntax and readability.  It's dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly, and it supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Here's a breakdown of some key features and aspects of Python:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, making it easier to debug and test.  This contrasts with compiled languages, where the entire code is converted to machine code before execution.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Dynamically Typed:**  You don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it.  Python infers the type based on the value assigned. This simplifies the code but requires careful attention to potential type-related errors.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Readability:** Python emphasizes code readability with its clean syntax and use of indentation to define code blocks.  This makes it easier to learn, understand, and maintain Python code compared to languages with more complex syntax.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and packages for a wide range of tasks, from web development and data science to system administration and GUI programming.  This reduces the need to rely on external libraries for many common operations.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Extensive Third-Party Libraries:** Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, covering almost any domain you can imagine.  Popular examples include NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, Django and Flask for web development, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning, and many more.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems, making it highly portable.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Community Support:** Python has a large and active community of developers, which means you can find ample resources, tutorials, documentation, and support online.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Who uses Python?**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Python is used in a wide variety of fields, including:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Web Development:** Building web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask.\n",
       "> * **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Analyzing data, building machine learning models, and creating data visualizations.\n",
       "> * **Scripting and Automation:** Automating tasks, writing scripts for system administration, and creating small utilities.\n",
       "> * **DevOps:** Managing infrastructure, automating deployments, and monitoring systems.\n",
       "> * **Scientific Computing:** Performing complex calculations, simulations, and data analysis.\n",
       "> * **Education:** Teaching programming concepts and introducing students to computer science.\n",

       "> * **Input Validation:** Added basic input validation when marking a to-do as complete to prevent index errors.\n",
       "> * **Docstrings:**  Comprehensive docstrings explain the purpose of each function and their parameters/return values, adhering to best practices.\n",
       "> * **File Handling:** Uses `with open(...)` to ensure files are properly closed even if errors occur.\n",
       "> * **JSON Persistence:**  Uses JSON to save and load the to-do list, providing a simple way to store data between sessions.\n",

       "> The `list_todos` function serves the crucial purpose of displaying the current state of the to-do list to the user.  Without it, the user would have no way of seeing the tasks they've added, checking which tasks are completed, or knowing which task to mark as complete.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Here's a breakdown of its importance:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 1. **Visibility:**  It provides a way for the user to see all their to-do items.  This is essential for any to-do list application.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 2. **Status Tracking:**  The function displays the completion status of each task (using `[x]` for completed and `[ ]` for incomplete), allowing the user to easily track their progress.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 3. **Context for Completion:**  When the user wants to mark a task as complete, they need to know the index or number associated with that task. `list_todos` displays the tasks with their corresponding numbers, providing the necessary context for the `mark_complete` function.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 4. **Feedback:** After adding a to-do item, the user can immediately see it in the list, confirming that the addition was successful.  This provides valuable feedback to the user.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> In short, the `list_todos` function is fundamental to the usability and functionality of the to-do list application.  It bridges the gap between the internal data (the `todos` list) and the user's understanding of their tasks.\n",
